description: Create and configure Liferay Data Sets (Frontend Data Sets) over Object entries through the data-set-admin API — table, list, and card views, columns and renderers, filters, default sort, row and creation actions, custom renderer and filter client extensions — then place the Data Set fragment on a page and move the definition between environments. Use when the user asks for a table, list, or card grid of object entries, a filterable listing, or a Data Set that renders nothing or crashes.

# Manage Data Sets

A **Data Set** is a configurable table, list, or card view over a REST collection, usually an object's `/o/c/<plural>`. It is built from the Data Set definition (the `data-set-admin` API) and the **Data Set fragment** placed on a page. The definition itself is stored as entries of the system object `L_DATA_SET`, with one related object per child type.

Everything below was verified live on 2026.q3.2 + hotfix-1 (2026-09-29): writes read back over the API, the rendered page checked in a browser, and admin UI shapes captured for comparison.

## When to Invoke

- "Show the books in a table", "a filterable list of …", "cards of …", "add a column / filter / sort / row action"
- A Data Set fragment shows nothing, "No Results Found", or "An unexpected error occurred"
- Moving a Data Set to another environment

Page placement is `manage-pages`, grants are `manage-roles-permissions`, and renderer or filter CETs are `scaffold-client-extension`.

## Prerequisites

- **Feature flag `LPS-164563`** (note the `LPS` prefix). Without it, `data-set-admin` returns `404`. See `feature-flags`.
- **The module has no version segment:** `/o/data-set-admin/data-sets`; `/o/data-set-admin/v1.0/…` returns `404`.
- **The OpenAPI spec is per resource**, not at the module root: `/o/data-set-admin/<resource>/openapi.json` for `data-sets`, `table-sections`, `sorts`, `actions`, `date-filters`, `selection-filters`, `client-extension-filters`, `list-sections`, `cards-sections`, `snapshots`. Read required fields there. `data-sets` also exposes `validate`, `batch`, `export-batch`, and `permissions`.

## 1. Create the Data Set

```bash
curl \
	--data '{
		"defaultItemsPerPage": 20,
		"externalReferenceCode": "<PROJECT>_<PURPOSE>_DS",
		"label": "<Display Name>",
		"listOfItemsPerPage": "10, 20, 50",
		"restApplication": "/c/<plural>",
		"restEndpoint": "/",
		"restSchema": "<ObjectDefinitionName>"
	}' \
	--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
	--request POST \
	--silent \
	--url "http://localhost:${PORT}/o/data-set-admin/data-sets" \
	--user "test@liferay.com:test"
```

- **Always choose the ERC.** It is the only portable pointer, and the page fragment references the Data Set by it. The admin UI cannot set one: it generates a UUID, which a later `PATCH` of `externalReferenceCode` can rename.
- **The fetch URL is `"/o" + restApplication + restEndpoint`.** So `restApplication` starts with `/` (`/c/<plural>`), and `restEndpoint` is `/` for an object. `"object-admin"` produces `/oobject-admin/`, a `404`, and an empty fragment.
- **A versioned Headless module** (e.g. Accounts) splits the path as `restApplication: "/headless-admin-user"`, `restEndpoint: "/v1.0/accounts"`. Put the version in `restEndpoint`, or it is dropped.
- **`restSchema` is not part of the URL.** Set it to the object's `name` (`restSchema: "ObjectEntry"` still renders).
- **`label` and `listOfItemsPerPage` are plain strings.** A map or an array is silently stored as its Java `toString()` (`{en_US=…}`, `"[10, 20, 50]"`) and shown that way in the admin list. `label_i18n` and `objectDefinitionId` do not exist and are ignored.
- **Display switches:**
  - `showSearch` (adds `&search=`) ;
  - `hideManagementBarInEmptyState` ;
  - `defaultVisualizationMode` (`table` | `list` | `cards`, lowercase) ;
  - `snapshotsEnabled` (user-saved views, stored separately in `/o/data-set-admin/snapshots`) ;
  - **`active: false` hides the whole fragment**, with no request and no message.
- **`POST /data-sets/validate` takes `{"values": {…}}`.** `{}` returns a `500` NPE, and it does not catch a map-valued `label`.

## 2. Add Children — Only Through the Nested Path

Columns, sorts, filters, actions, and view sections are separate entries linked to the Data Set. **Only the nested path works:**

```text
POST   /o/data-set-admin/data-sets/by-external-reference-code/<DS-ERC>/dataSetToDataSet<Child>
GET    /o/data-set-admin/data-sets/by-external-reference-code/<DS-ERC>/dataSetToDataSet<Child>
PATCH  /o/data-set-admin/data-sets/by-external-reference-code/<DS-ERC>/dataSetToDataSet<Child>/<child-erc>
DELETE /o/data-set-admin/data-sets/by-external-reference-code/<DS-ERC>/dataSetToDataSet<Child>/<child-erc>   → 204
```

The child types are `TableSections`, `ListSections`, `CardsSections`, `Sorts`, `DateFilters`, `SelectionFilters`, `ClientExtensionFilters`, and `Actions`. `/data-sets/{id}/…` works too.

- **The root collections** (`/o/data-set-admin/table-sections`, …) answer `409 "Conflict with postObjectEntry"` / `getObjectEntriesPage` to every call.
- **The back-references** on a child are `r_dataSetToDataSet<Child>_l_dataSetERC` / `_l_dataSetId`, with an `_l_` infix.
- **A nested `PUT` returns `404`.** `…/disassociate` fails because the relationship is required. Change a child with `PATCH`, or remove it with `DELETE`.
- **Children can also go inline in the create body**, as arrays named `dataSetToDataSet<Child>`: one call builds the whole Data Set.
- **Ordering.** The `*Order` fields on the Data Set (`tableSectionsOrder`, `sortsOrder`, …) are empty when built from the UI, but **`tableSectionsOrder` is writable and sets column order**: a comma-separated list of child ERCs. Unknown ERCs are ignored, and unlisted columns come last.

## 3. Columns (`dataSetToDataSetTableSections`)

```json
{
	"fieldName": "title",
	"label_i18n": {"en_US": "Title"},
	"renderer": "default",
	"rendererType": "internal",
	"sortable": true,
	"type": "string"
}
```

- **`type` is required but neither validated nor rendered.** The UI writes `string`, `number`, `integer`, or `boolean`; a Date field becomes `string`. The renderer decides the display.
- **Built-in `renderer` keys:** `default` (raw value; a picklist prints as JSON, a date as ISO), `label` (pill), `date`, `dateTime` (local time), `boolean` (Yes/No), `status` (workflow badge), `link`, `image`, `actionLink`, and `quantitySelector`. An unknown or missing key falls back to `default`. `rendererType` is `""` on UI-generated columns and `"internal"` once edited, and both render the same.
- **Dot notation:**
  - `genre.name` / `genre.key` read a picklist;
  - `<relationshipName>.<field>` (e.g. `authorToBooks.authorName`) reads the related entry, and the fragment adds `nestedFields` itself;
  - the raw FK field shows the numeric id.
- **Header sort** sends `sort=<field>:asc|desc` and works on direct fields. On a dotted field, the source answers `400 "Unable to sort by property: …"`, and the table silently keeps its order. So set `sortable: false` there, as the UI does. On a system object module (e.g. `/accounts`), only a fixed set of built-in properties sorts; source the Data Set from a child custom object instead, and show the parent through the reverse relationship's dot notation.
- **Never define two columns on the same `fieldName`.** The table renders one cell per distinct field, and every following column shifts under the wrong header.
- **A column's `active: false` is ignored at render.** Delete the column instead.
- **CSS hooks:** cells are `.cell-<fieldName>`, with dots becoming hyphens (`.cell-authorToBooks-authorName`), and headers are `th.cell-<fieldName>`. The markup itself is fixed.
- **The UI generates no column on create.** "Add Fields" → "Assign from Data Source" lists the fields, related ones included. Via the API, add every column yourself.

## 4. Filters

Give every filter a label: **a date filter without `label_i18n` never appears**. Use one filter per field: the UI enforces it, the API does not, and two filters on one field share their value.

**Date:**

```json
{"fieldName": "publicationDate", "label_i18n": {"en_US": "Published"}, "type": "date"}
```

It emits `filter=(publicationDate ge …) and (publicationDate le …)`.

**Picklist** (`dataSetToDataSetSelectionFilters`):

```json
{"fieldName": "genre", "include": true, "label_i18n": {"en_US": "Genre"}, "multiple": true, "preselectedValues": "[]", "source": "<LIST_TYPE_DEFINITION_ERC>", "sourceType": "OBJECT_PICKLIST"}
```

It emits `filter=(genre in ('…'))`, and `multiple: false` gives radio buttons with `eq`.

**Relationship:**

```json
{"fieldName": "r_<rel>_c_<parent>ERC", "include": true, "itemKey": "externalReferenceCode", "itemLabel": "<labelField>", "label_i18n": {"en_US": "Author"}, "multiple": true, "preselectedValues": "[]", "restApplication": "/c/<parent-plural>", "restEndpoint": "/", "restSchema": "<ParentName>", "source": "/o/c/<parent-plural>/", "sourceType": "API_REST_APPLICATION"}
```

This is the UI's shape: filter on the `…ERC` twin with `itemKey: "externalReferenceCode"`. The numeric FK with `itemKey: "id"` also works, since the id is sent quoted.

- **`include: false` is not honored.** Visitors have a runtime Exclude toggle instead.
- **`preselectedValues`** had no clear effect in testing; one form made the Filter button disappear.

**Static parameters.** `additionalAPIURLParameters` (e.g. `filter=genre eq 'sf'`) is AND-merged with the visitor's own filters. It is static: **there is still no native dynamic token mapping on 2026.q3.2**, so no current user, displayed entry, or relative date. An unresolved `{token}` is sent literally and matches nothing. The known workaround is a `globalJS` CET that rewrites `fetch` for URLs carrying `liferaydds=true` (verified on 2026.q2.11, not re-run on q3.2). Bind it to the page only (`manage-pages`).

## 5. Default Sort (`dataSetToDataSetSorts`)

```json
{"default": true, "fieldName": "publicationDate", "label_i18n": {"en_US": "Newest"}, "orderType": "desc"}
```

**A `Sorts` entry without `label` or `label_i18n` breaks the whole fragment** ("An unexpected error occurred."), with `NullPointerException: … "labelI18n" is null` at `CustomFDSSerializer.serializeSorts` in the log. Either field is enough, since the other is filled in. The initial request then carries `sort=<field>:<orderType>`. The UI always writes `orderType: "asc"`; set `desc` over the API.

## 6. Actions (`dataSetToDataSetActions`)

```json
{"label_i18n": {"en_US": "View"}, "permissionKey": "", "target": "link", "type": "item", "url": "/web/<site>/c_<objectname>/{friendlyUrlPath}"}
```

- **`type`:** `item` (per row; a lone row action shows as a button) or `creation` (a primary button in the management bar).
- **`target`:** `link`, `modal` (an iframe modal), `sidePanel`, and the untested `async` and `headless`.
- **`url` substitutes top-level row fields:** `{id}`, `{friendlyUrlPath}`, `{externalReferenceCode}`, `{title}`.
- **Link to an entry's default Display Page Template with `/web/<site>/c_<objectname>/{friendlyUrlPath}`.** `<objectname>` is the object `name`, lowercased and singular, which is the default `friendlyURLSeparator`. It needs no environment-specific id. The alternative `/web/<site>/e/<dpt-url>/<classNameId>/{id}` also works, but `classNameId` differs per environment. There is no ERC-based DPT URL on 2026.q3.2.
- **`permissionKey`** (e.g. `"UPDATE"`) hides the action from users lacking that permission on the entry (verified with a VIEW-only user).
- **`confirmationMessage_i18n`** shows a native `window.confirm`.
- **Order fields.** `itemActionsOrder` / `creationActionsOrder` stay empty.

## 7. List and Card Views

`dataSetToDataSetListSections` / `dataSetToDataSetCardsSections` entries are `{"fieldName": "<field>", "name": "title" | "description" | "image" | "symbol"}`, and dot notation works. With two or more views the fragment shows a view switcher. `defaultVisualizationMode` chooses the first view; empty or unknown falls back to Cards when a Cards view exists. `rendererName` on a list section does **not** apply a custom renderer.

## 8. Custom Renderers and Filters (CETs)

- **Cell renderer** (`fdsCellRenderer` CET): the column takes `"renderer": "LXC:<cet-key>"`, `"rendererType": "clientExtension"`. The module's default export is `({value, itemData}) => HTMLElement`, where `itemData` is the whole row, so a cell can depend on sibling fields.
- **Filter** (`fdsFilter` CET): a `dataSetToDataSetClientExtensionFilters` entry `{"clientExtensionEntryERC": "LXC:<cet-key>", "fieldName": "<field no other filter uses>", "label_i18n": {…}}`. The default export is an object: `descriptionBuilder(selectedData)` builds the chip, `htmlElementBuilder({filter, setFilter})` builds the panel, and `oDataQueryBuilder(selectedData)` returns the OData, e.g. an `OR` across fields that built-in filters cannot express. **The `LXC:` prefix is mandatory.** Without it the entry saves, and the render logs `No frontend data set filter client extension exists with the external reference code …`.
- **Escaping.** Escape user values in hand-built OData (`replace(/'/g, "''")`). Fetch option data with `Liferay.Util.fetch`.

## 9. Place the Data Set Fragment

The fragment references the Data Set by ERC. On a release carrying the **`LPD-102157`** fix (2026.q3.2 + hotfix-1, and later), the selection is a real item reference that the site-initializer tree and the live API can author, and that survives export. Without the fix, only the Page Editor can select the Data Set.

In the tree (`layouts/<page>/page-definition.json`):

```json
{
	"definition": {
		"fragment": {"key": "com.liferay.frontend.data.set.fragment.web.internal.fragment.renderer.FDSFragmentRenderer"},
		"fragmentConfig": {
			"itemSelector": {
				"className": "[$OBJECT_DEFINITION_CLASS_NAME:DataSet$]",
				"externalReferenceCode": "<DS-ERC>"
			}
		}
	},
	"type": "Fragment"
}
```

- **The key is the renderer class, with no `siteKey`.** `className` is the **`L_DATA_SET`** definition's class name (`DataSet` is its `name`), never the backing object's.
- **Over the live whole-page PUT,** the same reference goes under `fragmentConfigurationFieldValues.itemSelector = {"type": "Item", "value": {"itemExternalReference": {"className": …, "externalReferenceCode": …}}}`, with `defaultFragmentKey` = the renderer class.
- **Verify on the rendered page**, not by a GET.

**Order of operations:** the definition applies live, so edits show on reload with no redeploy. Placement is page composition: a redeploy of the initializer re-applies the page, and live edits made on that page are overwritten. The Data Set only has to exist at render time: the fragment renders nothing until it exists and has at least one view.

## Visibility

**Only the source entries matter.** Guest needs `VIEW` on the object's entries (`rules/guest-access.md`) and **nothing** on the Data Set definition itself. Without it, the fragment shows the standard "No Results Found", and REST returns `200` with no items.

## Moving a Data Set Between Environments

`POST /data-sets/export-batch` exports the definition **without its children**. Instead:

1. `GET /o/data-set-admin/data-sets/by-external-reference-code/<DS-ERC>?nestedFields=dataSetToDataSetTableSections,dataSetToDataSetActions,dataSetToDataSetCardsSections,dataSetToDataSetClientExtensionFilters,dataSetToDataSetDateFilters,dataSetToDataSetListSections,dataSetToDataSetSelectionFilters,dataSetToDataSetSorts`.
2. Strip ids, dates, creator, and the `r_…_l_dataSet*` back-references.
3. `POST` it to `/data-sets` (or `/data-sets/batch`) as one nested item.

**Child ERCs are unique per instance.** Re-importing on the same instance with unchanged child ERCs fails as a whole (`No ObjectEntry exists with the key {r_dataSetToDataSet…_l_dataSetId=…}`), so rename them for a copy.

**Deleting a Data Set is permanent and cascades to its children** (no recycle bin). The same ERC can be re-created afterwards.

## Not Verified

- The `async` and `headless` action targets.
- `preselectedValues`.
- Using the `dataset.everything` OAuth scope for real calls: it is accepted at CET deploy time, but no call was made with it.
- The dynamic-parameter `fetch` workaround on 2026.q3.

## Success Signal

- The page shows real rows for the intended audience, and each column shows the expected value.
- Filters emit the expected OData and narrow the rows.
- The default sort is applied on load, and actions open the right target.
- `GET …?nestedFields=…` lists every child under the chosen ERC.
